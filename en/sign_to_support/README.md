# Sign to Support BSC

If you are a Bitcoin holder, you can use the address that holds Bitcoin to generate a signature for supporting this project. The following provides the signing methods for two commonly used Bitcoin wallets, Bitcoin Core and Electrum. If your Bitcoin is in an exchange, you will need to transfer it to a personal wallet to generate the signature. Due to limitations of Bitcoin wallets, only signatures of "legacy" addresses (beginning with "1") are currently supported. If you encounter any difficulties during the signing process, you can contact us through the community.
