# BSC

<div align=center><img src="../logo.png"></div>

**BSC (Bitcoin Smart Contract)** is a great improvement to Bitcoin. It integrates the functionality of **smart contracts** into the Bitcoin system, giving **developers** the ability to build decentralized applications on Bitcoin. It would bring about a new **hard fork**, on which **Bitcoin holders** can use their existing funds directly. BSC will combine the unlimited creative space of smart contracts and the vast network effect of Bitcoin, which will be a very meaningful combination and exploration.
